# MSA Project 2 Plugins

### Current Issues
Current issues with my website are that I require the home page to have updated images depending on the latest post from each category. Another problem is that I want to have music to create atmosphere when users browse the website. However, the biggest problem is the lack of customisable options with the default WordPress tools, hindering the website from becoming more than a basic block of text. Without much knowledge on coding to self-write theme codes, the use of additional plugins brings quick and easy solutions to these problems.

### Plugin Types
The types of plugins that will solve the above issues are a front-end page builder plugin, as the bulk of the plugins, to widen the toolbox for customization of the website’s appearance and abilities. A featured image manipulator will also be needed to accomplish the goal of having dynamically changing images on the home page, whilst also making it easier and quicker to insert images. Next would be an audio player to act as an upgraded version of the default audio player and an auto publisher plugin, to enable the website home page to be always up to date and achieve the goals set above.

### Plugin Providers
The plugins chosen were: 
* Elementor Page Builder By Elementor.com 

This plugin has one of the highest active installation counts and has been updated recently. The good reviews were also an indication that the plugin worked as stated and I safe. The free version also covers all the tools I had required so bigger plugins were not needed. 

* Featured Image from URL By fifu.app

This plugin was the only one that had worked as desired after testing a large amount of similar feature image changing logins. Also, a lot of those plugins were quite old and not updated to the newest version of WordPress while fifu.app had updated it only 20hrs ago as of this report.

* WP Auto Republish By Sayan Datta

This plugin appeared to be one of the few available similar plugins and the most updated. It also only provides the one required task which saves bandwidth used by other plugins.

* Html5 Audio Player – Audio Player for WordPress By bPlugins

This was the most popular and simple to use audio plugin out of the many similar ones available, therefore it was the highest rated by many users. 

### Implementation steps
High level steps taken to implement the plugins were: 
* Elementor Page Builder By Elementor.com 

As the sole appearance layout of each page and post. Brought the option to add star ratings, image carousels and latest posts with cleaner graphics compared to the default WordPress options. It also gave the option to save templates of a type of page which made it easier to implement new posts without needed to reconfigure dimensions of widgets and general layouts repetitively. 

* Featured Image from URL By fifu.app

Mostly used on the 3 main pages, Movies, TV Shows and Video Games to allow the plugin to upload the first image on each page as the featured image, therefore allowing the selected theme to implement it onto the Home page. It was also used to quickly insert images straight from outer sources instead of downloading down and then uploading media, which made quick work when working with the many posts.

* WP Auto Republish By Sayan Datta

Implemented onto only the 3 main pages to have them be republished intervalley, allowing the Featured Image from URL plugin to update the latest featured image depending on the new posts added.

* Html5 Audio Player – Audio Player for WordPress By bPlugins

Placed on the Footnote to add atmosphere to the website with this audio player. It also allowed for looping and auto playing music anywhere on the site, which the default audio player lacked.  

### Expected benefits
Applicable benefits each plugin provided were:
* Elementor Page Builder By Elementor.com 

It gave us a wide variety of widgets such as star ratings and image carousels which add more interest to each page. 

* Featured Image from URL By fifu.app

Increases productivity rates as it is much easier to set images instead of having to save and upload each one, it has also allowed us to consistently have updated feature photos on the home page depending on the newest post results from each category

* WP Auto Republish By Sayan Datta

Automatically updates the home page to allow updated featured photos to appear which would have been a hassle if had to be done manually when ever a new post is added to the site.

* Html5 Audio Player – Audio Player for WordPress By bPlugins

Allows for greater control over the basic audio player provided by WordPress, adding interest to whenever the page is loaded and have people sitting back to read articles.


#MSA Project 3 

This persona is someone who wants to have an easy to access, digital cookbook so they can access their recipes on the go. This person is a 45 year old male who Is a stay at home dad who is also a cooking enthusiast. He is tired of sorting through his mountain of printout recipes he had downloaded from the internet, which he also keeps losing and forgetting if he is out and cooking for a friend somewhere that isn’t his own house. He also has the habit of losing the scraps of paper he always writes his shopping lists on, so because the one device he always has nearby is his phone, this app is a basic storage space for recipes and shopping lists.

On the home screen, there are options to choose a meal time, such as breakfast or lunch, which will filter out all the recipes that are not fit for the meal the user plans to make, clearing the clutter. He can also use the search bar if he knows the specific name or ingredient for the recipe. He can quickly add or edit new and existing recipes to increase his collection. The large and simple layout aids his ageing eyes and also gives him a easier time going through the app. For the shopping list, he can also very easily delete items he may have picked up during his shopping one handed in case he only has one hand available.

The app could be expanded to have a way to sort recipes by ingredients the user has at home. It would also be helpful if the app is able to access the internet and record a recipe from sites easily to save users from writing up recipes by themselves.
